Entries are in _posts.  Each field means as follows:

* title:  The name of the person.
* date:   The date of death in YYYY-MM-DD format.
* categories: Either the class in the form of "class-of-1974" or "staff". Can contain multiple values in cases where the person was both staff and student.
* tags: The causes of death.  Use the tags in _cause.
* images: A list of URLs to images.  Ideally local images such as "/assets/241166_1771058511999_6511222_o.jpg"
