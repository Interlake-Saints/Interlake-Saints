Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Hi there, I thought I would put together this list of questions and answers since I get asked the same ones a lot. Hope this explains everything.   :)

Who runs this page?

Hello. My name is Mario Lanza and I am an Interlake graduate from the [Class of 1992](/class-of-1992). I also run the class of 1992 reunion group.  Nice to meet you.

How did this page come about?

Well, this page originally started much smaller. One day, while I was doing research for our twenty year reunion, I learned that a friend of mine from the class of '92 had passed away. And I was surprised because I had never heard anything about it. So I asked around and I tried to find out what happened, and I was even more surprised to find out that nobody seemed to have any idea what had happened to him. It was all just this big mystery. 

What happened next is I went to the internet to start doing a little research, and I realized that there was almost no information out there about him. There was no online obituary, there was no date of death, there were no social security records, there was nothing. It was like he had never existed. And I thought, well that's terrible. How can a person pass away and there not be a single mention on the internet that he once existed as a person? What kind of a legacy for a person is that?

The more I thought about it, the more this bothered me. After all, with libraries and books going away in this age of digital media, it is extremely likely that in the future, the internet will be the only permanent record of society as we once knew it. I mean, this right here, this is it. The internet is going to be our generation's Library of Congress. So at this point I decided to put together a little online memorial. I called it "The Late and Great of the class of 1992", and it was supposed to just be an offshoot of our class of 1992 reunion group. And I thought that would be it. I put a little entry up for my friend Tony, I put up another entry for another girl in our class who had passed away, and I thought that was going to be the extent of it.

A few days later, a friend of mine emailed me. She asked if I could add an entry about her brother. He wasn't in the class of 92, but he had recently died in a car accident and she would love to see his name up there on the memorial as well. And then another friend came to me with a similar request about her brother, who had been in the class of 84. So I added entries for the two of them, and now my page wasn't just about the class of 1992 anymore. Now I had expanded it to be about the classes of the 80's and 90's.

Well you can probably guess what happened next. Once word got out that there was an online memorial to our lost IHS classmates, now I started to get dozens of emails, from all sorts of different people. People from classes way before mine started emailing me, with friends or family members or other loved ones who had died that they wanted me to write about. Or people they had just heard had died, and they were curious about some of the details since nobody seemed to know anything.

Within a couple of weeks, my humble little "The Late and Great of the Class of 1992" memorial had now become "[The Late and Great of Interlake High School](https://www.facebook.com/groups/101310529907451)." I now had dozens of entries up there on the page. And that was only the start of a memorial that would grow much bigger and much more detailed as people sent me more and more and more info to add to it over the years.

How long has the Interlake High School Memorial Wall been here?

I started it in late 2008. It was a Facebook group at first, but as it got bigger and I added more entries, I eventually switched it from being a group to being a public page. Which is nice, because now that it's a page you don't have to request to join a group anymore if you want to read it. Now anyone on the internet can read it. In fact, most people don't know this, but you don't even have to have an account on Facebook to read this page.  Anyone can go to [https://facebook.com/ihsmemorial](https://facebook.com/ihsmemorial) and the entire IHS Memorial Page is publicly available to anyone on the internet now.

Why did the name switch from "The Late and Great of Interlake" to the "Interlake High School Memorial Wall"?

When I made the switch from a group to a page, I changed the name of it so that people wouldn't be confused.  

These days the Interlake High School Memorial Wall is the only page that I make updates to. The old "Late and Great of Interlake" group still does exist on Facebook, but I don't update it anymore, and I haven't posted any new updates there since about 2011.  I am probably going to delete the old group one of these days, I just haven't gotten around to it yet.  And yes all the information in that group was moved over here a couple of years ago. This is the only current Interlake memorial list now.

Why post the Interlake Memorial here on Facebook?  Why not on a reunion site like classmates.com?

The reason I wanted to do it on Facebook is because Facebook is free. That's the only reason.  

Yes, you can find information about classmates who have passed away on other reunion sites, usually under headers like "in memoriam" or "lost classmates". But their lists are nowhere near as complete as this one is going to be. And besides (this is the part that I hate) most reunion websites will generally charge you a fee if you want to find information like that. That's the part that absolutely drives me crazy about them. Reunion sites will be like, oh so you want to learn about your lost classmates? Well pay us ten dollars. Then you can find out about them. How about that, we'll hold this information for ransom unless you pay us.

I have a problem with websites that charge money for information that is perfectly free on the internet if you go around looking for it, and that's why I thought it would be nice to undercut all the pay sites and collect this information for free right here on Facebook. This way, everyone can read it for free, and they can share their memories and comments for free. No one will never have to pay for that privilege anymore. 

Where do you get all the information for the entries?

Well, this is where I mostly depend on you. I would say that 90% of the information on the IHS Memorial Wall has been emailed to me by friends and family members of the people who died. Yes, some entries I have managed to put together myself, but for the most part what happens is that people will email me names or dates or class years and then they will ask me to go put together an entry for them.  

When I get a request like this (and I still do get a lot of them), for the most part all I really need from you is a name and a class year. Personal details about the person are great too, of course. If you have anything you would like me to write about a person, just tell me and I will add it to their entry. But really all I need from you at minimum is a name and the year they graduated (or were scheduled to graduate.) I can generally track down the rest of the info on my own. And I will tell you right now that the best places to go for information about a person who has died are legacy.com and ancestry.com. That is almost always where I start when I need to find some info about a person who has passed away. That or plain old just google their name.

Where did you get all the pictures?

Some of the pictures were sent in by friends and family members, and some I just took right off a person's online obituary if a picture had been included with it. But for the most part, the majority of the pictures on the IHS Memorial Wall just came from old yearbooks.  

Did you know that classmates.com has a digital copy of nearly every Interlake yearbook from the years 1968-1988 available on their website? And that unlike most things on most reunion websites,  the old yearbooks are free?  If you didn't know that before, well now you do.  When I need to find a picture of someone, I just go to classmates.com and I find an old yearbook photo of anyone who I need to write an entry about.  I prefer to use senior pictures if possible, since they are generally bigger and they have generally been scanned in clearer than a person's underclass pictures were. If I can't find a senior picture, I can at least usually find a sophomore or a junior picture to use as a backup.  

Does anyone ever get upset about something you have posted about their loved one?

From my experience, the only thing that has really been consistent over the years is that (understandably) loved ones don't want you to mention if the cause of death was suicide. From day one, people have consistently emailed me and asked me not to mention that in any of my writeups. So I won't. I will only include details about how a person died if A) the family and friends have already okayed it with me, or B) it was specifically mentioned how they died in their obituary. So to answer your question, no, no one has ever been upset that I posted an entry about their loved one. In fact, quite the opposite, most of the emails I get are from people who are thrilled that someone took the time to actually write a tribute to their loved one in the first place.  

Which leads me to say that, despite its appearance, the IHS Memorial really isn't a sad website for the most part. Yes, it might be sad at first. When you first look around at the number of entries, it might be a little overwhelming. But if you saw all the emails that I get from people who are appreciative of what has been posted about their friend/parent/sibling/classmate, you would realize that this is actually a very comforting place for a lot of people. Most people are genuinely happy that their loved one has even been remembered at all. That is the sentiment I hear over and over again, in almost every single email I have received over the years. And that is the main reason why I will never stop updating this page.  After you die, it seems like the most important thing in the big picture is that the world just remembers you.

How accurate is all the information here?

It's pretty darn accurate as far as I can tell. I mean, I can't guarantee that every single little date is absolutely perfect. And some of the causes of death might be written a little vague sometimes. But if I post something on this page, you can be sure I have generally confirmed it from at least two or three sources first. I will never write a sentence on this page unless I have a pretty good idea it's the truth.  

In regards to names, I have done my best to confirm names and middle names and spellings of names in every single IHS yearbook I had available to me. I've also verified names through every single SSN index and ancestry page that you can find on the internet. And it gets tricky sometimes, because one thing I have noticed over the years is that people have their names misspelled in yearbooks A LOT!

Is everything on the IHS Memorial 100% accurate? Probably not. But I can guarantee it's at least 99% accurate. And, of course, if you see something that you know is inaccurate, please email me as soon as possible so I can fix it. After all, I hate inaccuracies on my page even more than I hate websites that charge for free obituary info. Please don't let me post something that is inaccurate on this page.

Have any entries been harder for you to write than others?  Is it difficult to run this page?

Oh absolutely, it can be incredibly difficult at times.  

If you think about it, I've never met 99% of the people on this list. So I am sort of fortunate in the sense that I don't know a lot of the people that I am writing about. In that sense, I'm really just here for their friends and loved ones, I'm really just here to make sure the entry comes out the way that they would like it to come out.  
But I won't lie to you, there are some entries on this page that really got to me. Specifically, I had two good friends from Interlake ([Jenny Johnstone](/class-of-1992/jennifer-brooks-johnstone/) and [Colleen Hansen](/class-of-1992/colleen-marie-hansen/), both class of '92) who passed away after I first started putting together this page, and both of them actually helped me with a lot of the earlier entries and helped me pull together some of the original info. So having to write entries for them a few years later came as a bit of a shock. And then there's another entry on this list, [Melissa Waller](/class-of-1996/melissa-waller/) from the class of '96-- her entry is one I will always remember. Melissa was diagnosed with stage four cancer at the age of 31. And, as a child of the digital age, she was able to document her battle with cancer on her online blog. She posted in that blog almost right up until the day that she died. Those are the stories that tend to stick with me, because there is so much info out there about what her last year was like before she died. And hers isn't the only entry like that, she's just one that pops into my head when people ask me which of the entries on this list was the hardest to write. And no, I never actually knew Melissa. I just know her from reading through her cancer blog.

By the way, before this question bums you out, let me quickly add that I have had far more fun running this page than I have ever been depressed by it. I am so grateful for all the interesting IHS alums I have gotten to know over the past eleven years, either because they sent me an email or we corresponded behind the scenes via direct message. I mean, these are people I never would have met if I hadn't put together this page. Seriously, how often would a 1992 IHS graduate ever meet a 1969 IHS graduate or a 2010 IHS graduate? I have learned so much about the history of our high school (and the history of Bellevue in general) through this project, and I've had a chance to become friends with some amazing people I never would have gotten to know otherwise. So yes, while it can be tough to run this website at times, the relationships I have made out of it have more than made up for it.

I can honestly say that after eleven years of digging through Interlake's history, and its yearbooks, and its people, and its names, and learning about which teachers and administrators were there for how many years, I probably know as much about IHS history as anyone at this point. And at this point this is where I'll say the one thing that I believe all of us over the years can agree on: Muck Fercer.

Does this page have any relationship to the IHS Memorial Plaque on campus?  If not, who runs that?

Well, that's kind of the million dollar question around here. Who -does- run that plaque? This question has come up numerous times over the years, and no matter how many people I talk to or ask about it, nobody ever seems to know the answer.

Do I have anything to do with the IHS Memorial Plaque? Nope. That plaque existed way before I ever went to Interlake. By the time I showed up on campus in 1988 it was already firmly established right there in front of the administration building. We already had a memorial to all of our former classmates who had died.  

That plaque still exists on campus, by the way. Only it isn't in front of the administration office anymore. Now they have hidden it way out in the garden in front of the horticulture building. These days, you actually have to go through a gate (or climb over a locked fence) and search around under a tree if you want to find it. I know that because I've, uh, personally climbed that fence myself a couple of times just so I could go take pictures of it. Shhh, don't tell anyone.

So now, the big question. Who maintains that plaque? Does anyone know? I certainly don't know. In fact, last time I stopped by campus and I looked at the plaque, no new entries had been added to it for a couple of years. And some of the older entries have long since faded out or have recently been covered by spray paint. Some of the REALLY old entries are just 100% completely unreadable now. It seems pretty obvious to me these days that no one maintains it.

A couple of years ago somebody told me that we have an Interlake Alumni Group that maintains that plaque. But that was eight years ago and I have yet to hear any follow-up about who that group actually is or who is actually in it. So I would be willing to bet that NO ONE actively maintains the IHS Memorial Plaque anymore. And it's depressing to see, because I think it has been left out there to fade in the sun like an abandoned car.  

Obviously, I would love if someone could tell me otherwise, and prove to me that it actually is being maintained. But... I'll believe it when I see it. Also, I should point out that I am not local, I've lived down in Southern California since 1999. So there is very little I could do to keep it maintained or do anything about it these days.

Finally, where on this page do I find the info about all of our deceased IHS graduates?

That's easy. Just go back to the main page and click on "Notes." All the information I have about every IHS graduate who has passed away over the years can be found in the notes. I have even broken them down by graduating class so they are easier to navigate. I also have a photo album dedicated to each class if you prefer to just look at the pictures. Fair warning though, I couldn't find pictures for everyone, so there are more people listed under "notes" than there are in the photo albums.

Thanks for reading.  Enjoy the page!
