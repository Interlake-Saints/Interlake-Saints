Shelley, aka Shelley Parsons Hagerty, was an accomplished sales professional who often received rewards for her sales skills and her leadership. She pursued a successful career in sales until she needed a liver transplant in March of 2013. She was on dialysis for the next three years after her kidneys failed to respond to the transplant. She finally received a new kidney in December 2015, and she was anxiously looking forward to going back to work and a more normal life, when she died unexpectedly at her home on May 12, 2016.  She was 48 years old.  Shelley's full obituary can be found [here](http://tinyurl.com/jftllbf).
