Gary was a teacher and football coach at River View High School in Finley, WA for many years, where he developed a rare and unique bond with both his students and his fellow educators. He especially had a way with reaching troubled students, as one of his colleagues pointed out, "He was able to get those kids to see their self-worth." Gary coached at River View for so long that his name eventually became synonymous with high school football in the region. As one news report after his death pointed out, â€œWhen you think about River View football, the first name that comes to mind is Gary Everson." Gary retired from River View in 2014, and he died of pancreatic cancer four years later, on October 12, 2018. He was 62 years old.
