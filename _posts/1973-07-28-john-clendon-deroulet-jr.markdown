John was murdered by fellow IHS student William Gregory Warren on July 28, 1973.  His body was found the next day in Frink Park on Lake Washington in the Leschi area.  He had been shot six times in the back.  He was only 17 years old.  After the murder, John's parents established a scholarship in his name that financially helped many students in the Interlake Jazz program attend music and jazz camps for many years.
