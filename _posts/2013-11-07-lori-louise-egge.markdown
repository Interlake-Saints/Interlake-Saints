Lori earned her pilot's license in the early 80's, and she eventually founded Sky Trekking Alaska.  Over the years, she flew thousands of people on once in a lifetime adventures across Alaska and occasionally into Russia and the Northwest Territories. Twenty times she flew the Iditarod, and she eventually accumulated more than 15,000 hours of accident free flying in bush Alaska.  Sadly, she passed away November 7, 2013 at her home in Wasilla surrounded by her friends and family following a hard-fought 16-month battle with an exceedingly rare form of small cell carcinoma. She was 53 years old.  Lori's complete obituary can be found [here](http://tinyurl.com/oalnqdg).  A video tribute to her life can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/82436756).
