Wendy, aka Wendy Lynn Patterson, died in West Valley City, Utah on December 18, 2006. She was in the hospital recovering from a minor car accident when a blood clot ruptured in her heart. She died instantly just as she was being released from the hospital. Her sister set up a blog in her honor [here](http://www.wendysangelwings.blogspot.com/).
