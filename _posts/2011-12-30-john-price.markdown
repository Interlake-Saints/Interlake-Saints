John was one of my all time favorites.  Always a quick smile and supportive friend.  Remained friends after HS.  Noticed he wasn’t here.  He is someone who touched so many as IHS counseler and principal.  A gentle soul.  He should be remembered with much grace.  I’m sure he has a special place in Heaven.
