Ellen, aka Ellen Gifford Gilbert, was blessed with a sharp wit and a great sense of humor. She loved travel, skiing, white water rafting, and Motown music. She was the life of the party, as her friends will attest. She worked at the phone company for thirty years (PNB/US West/Qwest/Centurylink) where she made many lifelong friends before retiring in 2006. Sadly, Ellen left us on June 21, 2020, after a long battle with melanoma and dementia. A fighter to the end, she was 64 years old.
