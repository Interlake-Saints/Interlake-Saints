I have updated the entry for Clayton Dale Carlisle '70.  

I knew that Clayton was a student at UW who died his junior year (1973) but I couldn't find any details on what happened to him.  Linda Tullar Vesey was nice enough to email me and fill me in.  Clayton was a forrestry major at UW who died in a 1973 helicopter crash while battling a forest fire. 

In his honor, the University of Washington immediately created the Clayton Dale Carlisle Memorial Scholarship, which is still handed out today, nearly 40 years later.

Thanks for the info Linda!
