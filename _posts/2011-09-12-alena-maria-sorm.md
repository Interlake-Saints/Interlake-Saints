Alena was born with a rare genetic mutation called Ataxia Telangiectasia. Although she could never comb her own hair or brush her own teeth, when she was 13 she discovered horses - and Little Bit Therapeutic Riding Center in Woodinville took her under their wing. Alena became an accomplished western rider, and was invited to compete in horse shows all over the United States. She rode horses for many years before passing away at home in Woodinville on September 12, 2011. She was 48 years old.
