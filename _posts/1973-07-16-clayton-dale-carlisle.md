Clayton was a forestry major at the University of Washington. He passed away in a helicopter accident on July 16, 1973, while trying to fight a forest fire. In his honor, the University of Washington created the Clayton Dale Carlisle Memorial Scholarship, which is still handed out today, more than 40 years later.
