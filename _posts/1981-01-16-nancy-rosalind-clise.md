Nancy died in an accident in Hawaii on January 16, 1981.  She was in an appliance store in Waimea on the island of Kauai when she opened the store refrigerator and it fell off a platform and onto her.  She was only 24 years old. 

Sadly, her brother Charles also died in an accident, two and a half years earlier. He is also listed on the IHS Memorial Page, under the class of 1973.
