She was a regular at the Highland Community Center in Bellevue and volunteered at the Issaquah Food Bank. For the last five years Jenny lived in “Mountain House,” her group home in Issaquah. She developed close bonds with her caregivers and co-residents.

Jenny will be missed by her parents, Geoff and Sabina, brother Ben, sister Gabi (Casey) Gibson, and nephew Max Gibson.
