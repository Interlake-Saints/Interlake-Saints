Bob Levitin ("Ditto Bob", as he was known to his players) taught at both Newport and Interlake, and he was one of the most popular faculty members in Interlake history. Always positive and uplifting, he was a true gentleman, liked by all. He was so well respected, in fact, that the Newport '66 yearbook was actually dedicated to him. Bob was not only a great teacher, he was also a great coach, as his 1986 IHS baseball team won the state championship. On top of being a great teacher and coach, Bob was also a military veteran; having served in World War II under General Patton's Third Army in Europe. Sadly, Bob Levitin passed away on February 9th, 2020.
