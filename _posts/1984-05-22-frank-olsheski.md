Frank Olsheski taught industrial arts at Interlake between 1968 and 1984. He died of pancreatic cancer on May 22, 1984.  A tribute to him was printed in the 1985 yearbook.

In the floor of the old gym's foyer, a mosaic of the school crest was laid by the classes of 1979 through 1984 in memory of Frank. As part of the renovation, the artwork was relocated into the new foyer. [A Seattle Times article](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20050911&slug=renovations09m) about the murals and memorials mentions the mosaic.
