Frank Olsheski was a very popular teacher who taught industrial arts at Interlake between 1968 and 1984. He died of pancreatic cancer on May 22, 1984. A year later, a tribute to him was printed in the 1985 IHS yearbook (which you can see below).

Mr. Olsheski's death at such a young age (he was only in his mid-thirties) was something a lot of students from that era never forgot. In fact, the classes of 1979 through 1984 later collaborated on a SECOND memorial to the beloved "Mr. O." A tiled mosaic of the IHS school crest was laid in the school foyer (see picture, below) in his honor. 

This mosaic was later relocated into the foyer of the new building when Interlake underwent campus renovations in the early 2000's. [A Seattle Times article](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20050911&slug=renovations09m) about the school's murals and memorials mentions Mr. Olsheski's mosaic.
