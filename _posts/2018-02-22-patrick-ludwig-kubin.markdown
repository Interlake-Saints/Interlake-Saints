Pat was a well known attorney, community leader, and advocate for disadvantaged children in the city of Longview. He was also a longtime member of the Longview Ski and Outdoors Club. Snow skiing was Pat's passion. Over the course of his lifetime, he went on ski trips to Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Lake Tahoe, Wyoming and all over the northwest, and at night he often dreamed he was skiing. Sadly, Pat died in a freak accident on February 22, 2018 at Mount Hood Meadows Ski Resort. On his last run of the day, his bindings inexplicably broke and he was thrown headfirst into a hole in the snow. Rescuers administered CPR on the scene but he was never responsive. He was 58 years old. You can read a summary of Pat's extraordinary life (that he wrote himself, four years before he died) [here](https://tinyurl.com/ybvz6hd3).
