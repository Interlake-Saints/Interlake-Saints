Kris, who was also known as Kris von Oy, was a talented artist who designed and built many famous gathering places in the Seattle area, including Bauhaus Books and Coffee, the Baltic Room and Caffe Vita on Capitol Hill, and the Alibi Room in Pike Place Market. He did everything from creating logos and designing the interiors to swinging a hammer when construction time came. Sadly, he died in a one-car accident on West Magnolia Boulevard in Seattle on July 19, 2002. He was only 35 years old.
