Tom's career in education in the Seattle area spanned nearly 40 years. He was a fixture at Interlake for most of its early years, joining the faculty as a young science and electronics teacher in 1968, and continuing at IHS as a math and science teacher well into the mid to late 1990's. His inquiring spirit made him a leader in the field of technology, and in the early 70's he was actually featured in Time magazine as a pioneer in the implementation of how students can use computers in the classroom. Tom died peacefully on June 1, 2016, at the age of 77, at his home in Seattle with his loved ones nearby. His obituary can be found [here](https://tinyurl.com/y28hkeby).
