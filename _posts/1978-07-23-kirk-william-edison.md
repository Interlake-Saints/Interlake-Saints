Kirk died in a skydiving accident on July 23, 1978, the summer after his sophomore year, when his parachutes malfunctioned over the Issaquah Parachute Center.  He was only 16 years old.  Kirk's parents created a memorial page for him in the 1979 IHS yearbook, a copy of which is posted in the group photo album.
