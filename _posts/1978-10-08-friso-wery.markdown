Friso (who some people knew as Cisco) died of cystic fibrosis during his senior year of high school, on October 8, 1978. In his honor, a tree was planted in the memorial garden with his name on it.  He also got a special memorial page in the 1979 IHS yearbook, which can be found in the photo album.
