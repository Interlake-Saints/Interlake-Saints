Mike came to Interlake in 1981 as a counselor, and he returned in 1987 as an Assistant Principal.  He later became part of a three principal team along with Don Barnhart and Sarah Phillips - the first time in the state this had ever been attempted.  After several years of serving IHS and being instrumental in bringing in the International Baccalaureate program, Mike transferred to Bellevue High School in 1996.  Overall, he spent 33 years in the Bellevue School District, serving as a teacher, counselor, and administrator.  He died at the age of 66 on November 12, 2015, after a brief battle with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
