Cass was murdered by an acquaintance in Chico, California on March 16, 2015.  She was 55 years old.

Sadly, Cass is not the only member of her family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her younger brother, [Kurt Edison](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1980/kirk-william-edison/), is listed under the Class of 1980.
